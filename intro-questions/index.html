                As a CS major, I thought that it would be useful to learn about effective design 
                and communication for front end development.
            </li>
            <li>
                I have some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from CSE 204
            </li>
            <li>
                I hope to build a portfolio that demonstrates a strong understanding of
                good front end development practices

                Screen design needs to look good and function properly on a variety of different devices
                that differ in screen size and physical interface that controls the cursor (ie. mouse vs. touch)
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify's</a> website demonstrates effective design
                because there is a clear hierarchy of information that guides the viewer to actionable 
                content. Additionally, headers and titles are concise and larger than other other pieces
                of information which shows their importance.

                <a href="https://www.charitywater.org/donate">Charity Water's</a> website demonstrates effective
                communication because it gets straight to the point. There is an immediate call to action with
                the donation form, and easily accessable links to more information about the cause.                 
            </li>

                The <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a> website works well because it is clear
                and concise. It immediately directs the view to "get Spotify free" or login. It explains its 
                purpose and value in a 4 word header and 9 word subheader.
