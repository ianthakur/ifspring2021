        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Your day breaks, your mind aches</p>
            <p>You find that all her words of kindness linger on</p>
            <p>When she no longer needs you</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza" >
            <p>She wakes up, she makes up</p>
            <p>She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry</p>
            <p>She no longer needs you</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza chorus" >
            <p>And in her eyes you see nothing</p>
            <p>No sign of love behind the tears</p>
            <p>Cried for no one</p>
            <p>A love that should have lasted years</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="stanza" >
            <p>You want her, you need her</p>
            <p>And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead</p>
            <p>You think she needs you</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza chorus" >
            <p>And in her eyes you see nothing</p>
            <p>No sign of love behind the tears</p>
            <p>Cried for no one</p>
            <p>A love that should have lasted years</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza" >
            <p>You stay home, she goes out</p>
            <p>She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone</p>
            <p>She doesn't need him</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza" >
            <p>Your day breaks, your mind aches</p>
            <p>There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head</p>
            <p>You won't forget her</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza chorus" >
            <p>And in her eyes you see nothing</p>
            <p>No sign of love behind the tears</p>
            <p>Cried for no one</p>
            <p>A love that should have lasted years</p>
